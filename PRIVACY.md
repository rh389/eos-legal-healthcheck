# My HealthCheck Privacy and Data Policy

To provide the Eos Products, we must process information about you. The type of information that we collect depends on how and which of our products you use. The My HealthCheck app (the “App”) collects, stores and/or processes data under three broad categories:

1.  **Device and usage statistics** - basic diagnostic data such as usage statistics and crash reporting, used for improving the product.
2.  **HealthCheck** - actively gathered health and lifestyle data forming the NHS Health Check, used to deliver the core function of the App.
3.  **HealthTrack** - opt-in passively gathered activity and fitness data, used to deliver an enhanced experience to the user and for health research purposes.

These purposes, the precise data gathered, and the lawful basis for use are detailed under the corresponding headings below:

## 1. Device and usage statistics
Eos is the *data controller* for data processed under this heading.

### What kinds of information do we collect?

Under this heading Eos processes:

*  Pseudo-anonymised device attributes. This includes information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.
*  Pseudo-anonymised crash reports and usage statistics. This includes information about operations and behaviours performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).

### How do we use this information?

Promote safety, integrity and security. We use the information that we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off Eos Products. For example, we use data that we have to investigate suspicious activity or breaches of our Terms or Policies, or to detect when someone needs help.

### How is this information shared?
Third party platform providers, such as Apple and Google, are involved in processing this information in order to gather and present it to Eos. Eos does not share this data with other parties.

### What is our legal basis for processing data?

Eos processes this data as a legitimate interest. Users of software in general expect software developers to quickly identify problems and improve the stability and usefulness of the software, and expect that they will process non-sensitive and non-identifiable data to do so. It is necessary to collect this feedback automatically to obtain statistically significant numbers of reliable, technical reports across the wide variety of devices and configurations on which the App may run.
